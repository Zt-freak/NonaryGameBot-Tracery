        "There's a piece of paper under the pillow...",
        "There's nothing else under the pillow.",
        "The middle bunk. There's a thin mattress on it.",
        "Somebody's painted a big, red 5 on the door.",
        "This lock is unlocked. Awesome.",
        "The only door in and out of this room is right next to the weird device.",
        "I guess that's a lever, huh.",
        "...Well, it looks like pulling on the lever just makes a weird noise. Great.",
        "Damnit! Why the hell isn't this thing opening?!",
        "The groove on the side of this thing looks like it's made to have a key card swiped through it or something like that.",
        "Maybe if I can find a card, I can unlock this thing.",
        "It's a mysterious device with a lever on it.",
        "It's got what looks like a card reader on the side, but it's the weirdest card reader I've ever seen.",
        "These cards with numbers on them... I'm pretty sure this is where I'm supposed to use them.",
        "All right, let's slide this card and see if it works.",
        "What am I doing wrong? Do I have the wrong cards?",
        "I think I'm gonna need some other colors if I'm gonna get anything out of this thing.",
        "It looks like just one color of card isn't going to do the trick.",
        "This note says ?? in red and ?? in blue. Huh... Is there a reason it's folded like a mountain?",
        "So someone wrote a bunch of numbers and symbols on the back of the picture, huh.",
        "There are a bunch of numbers and symbols written on the back of this photo...",
        "1 through 5 are empty, and 6 through 9, as well as 0, are colored in.",
        "Maybe this has something to do with the relationship between the symbols and the numbers.",
        "It's totally a picture of a ship. An old cruise liner, by the looks of it.",
        "This key's pretty small... Definitely not for a door.",
        "A small [blue key]. Maybe it's supposed to open something blue?",
        "Man... What the hell happened to me?",
        "How did I end up here...?",
        "Consider this a privilege. You have been chosen.",
        "You are going to participate in a game.",
        "The Nonary Game",
        "It is a game...where you will put your life on the line.",
        "That's right! That guy with the gas mask!",
        "That son of a bitch must have taken me here!",
        "The Nonary Game, huh...",
        "What the hell is a Nonary Game!? Goddamnit!",
        "A door! Another door!",
        "Wha...what the hell...?",
        "A wave?!",
        "Sh-Shit! I gotta get outta here!",
        "I guess there's another one of us now.",
        "Hey! You! Come on! Hurry!",
        "Hmph. One of us, huh...?",
        "Going up won't do you any good! There are 2 doors, but neither of them will open!",
        "Come on! Aren't you coming? You gotta hurry!",
        "That's 9 of us, then. All of the cards are in hand.",
        "Hey! What the hell're you just standing there for!?",
        "They're the same...",
        "The room I woke up in had a number on the door, just like that.",
        "Yes, we all saw the same thing! That's not important! We need to hurry!",
        "Ya think I don't know that, lady!?",
        "RRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHH!",
        "Gah...!",
        "Oh my gosh... Is that you, Jumpy!?",
        "A-Akane!?",
        "Welcome aboard.",
        "I welcome you all, from the bottom of my heart, to this, my vessel.",
        "I am Zero... The captain of this ship.",
        "I am also the person who invited you here.",
        "Hey! Asshole! What the hell is this?! C'mon out here! I wanna get a look at you!",
        "What do you mean to do to us?!",
        "I mean to have you participate in a game.",
        "Some of you, I know, are familiar with this game.",
        "The Nonary Game. It is a game...where you will put your life on the line.",
        "The rules of the [Nonary Game] can be found upon your persons.",
        "They are simple rules. Read them.",
        "Hey... There's something in my pocket... Check this out.",
        "Then it would seem Zero has seen fit to grace us each with a letter.",
        "Would you mind terribly reading it to us, young man?",
        "On this ship, you will find a handful of doors emblazoned with numbers.",
        "We will call them the numbered doors.",
        "The doors in front of you are a pair of the same.",
        "The key to opening these numbered doors are the numbered bracelets that each of you possess.",
        "Only those who have opened the door may pass through.",
        "Only 3-5 people can pass through one numbered door.",
        "All those who enter must leave, and all who enter must contribute."
